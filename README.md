# RapidFloodImpact

**RapidFloodImpact** is a tool designed to identify short-range flood impacts by merging local storm reports (LSRs) with National Water Model (NWM) streamflow forecasts. This integration helps highlight areas at increased flood risk in near-real time, supporting situational awareness and decision-making.

## Features

- Ingests and geolocates local storm reports (e.g., flash flooding, heavy rain)
- Aligns reports with corresponding NWM stream segments and forecast data
- Flags high-risk areas based on timing and flow thresholds
- Designed for rapid-response workflows and short-term forecasting

## Use Cases

- Emergency management and flood response
- Hydrologic situational awareness
- Meteorological operations and impact-based forecasting

## Getting Started

Setup instructions, dependencies, and example workflows coming soon.

## Data Sources

- National Water Model (NOAA)
- Local Storm Reports (NWS)
